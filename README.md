# Object-Detection-using-PyTorch
---

Object Detection for Computer Vision using Deep Learning with Python. Train and Deploy (Detectron2, Faster RCNN, YOLOv8)

#### Whats Object Detection ?
- The goal of Object detection is to train a Deep learning model which can look at the image of multiple objects to detect and localizing individual pbjects present in the image.

**GOAL**
- FrameWork - PyTorch
- Deep Learning Architectures - CNN, RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN and YOLO8, Detectron2
- Outcome -
  - 1. Learn how to leverage pre-trained models, fine-tune them for Object Detection
    2. Single-Stage Object Detection vs Two-Stage Objection Detection
    3. Single-Stage Object Detection vs Two-Stage Objection Detection
    4. Perform Object Instance Segmentation at Pixel Level using Mask RCNN
